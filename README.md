## NoiseApp - Welcome:  <img src="https://github.com/projectNoiseRome/projectNoiseRome/blob/master/MockUp/icon.png" alt="Drawing" width="50" height="50"/>
NoiseApp is an accademic project developed for the Pervasive System class a Univerity of Rome - La Sapienza, Master Degree in Computer Engineering<br />
The goal of the project is to have a noise map of the city, in order to achieve better booking for tourist based on their preferences: for example, young tourist may like to be near a zone with high nightlife activities(so with a higher noise of level) and viceversa a family maybe want to avoid such places. On the other side, having a noise map of the city give us the possibility to study the noise pollution in a city like Rome, that make the project really intresting in term of utilization: acquiring the noise level data allow the user to find the best place for any eventuality and allow the researchers to study the noise phenomenon<br />

## System Composition:
Android App : https://github.com/projectNoiseRome/NoiseApp  <br />
Microsoft Azure(Tomcat + MySql) website : http://noiseappproject.azurewebsites.net/ (work in progress)

## Road to NoiseApp:
### Composition of the team - first half of March 2017:
In the first day of march we met and start to think about what kind of project we could realize in three months, considering the time of the develop plus the testing phase, and of course the theme for the Pervasive System class. After studying a little bit the main challenge for the smart city, we decide that the best field to approach was the sound one, in particular the monitoring of the noise level. 


### Presentantion of the idea and Mockup - second half of March 2017:
We explain in a first short presentation what was our idea, to build a noise map with some static sensor always transmitting data to a server, and then an Android app to merge and show the data. We needed some days to choose any of the technical aspects, and in the end we decide to develop a Java REST server and to use a MySql database in order to host the final product on Microsoft Azure cloud platform. Then we focus on the Android mock up, to show to the user in order have an idea if we were going in the right way. Here we show some images of our initial design(made with Balsamiq Mockups):

# ProjectNoiseRome
An accademic project developed in for the Pervasive System class a Univerity of Rome - La Sapienza, Master Degree in Computer Engineering<br />
The goal of the project is to have a noise map of the city, in order to achieve better booking for tourist based on their preferences: for example, young tourist may like to be near a zone with high nightlife activities(so with a higher noise of level) and viceversa a family maybe want to avoid such places. <br />
Here we will post all the code that we'll write, stay tuned!

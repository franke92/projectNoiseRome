## NoiseApp - Introduction:
NoiseApp is an accademic project developed for the Pervasive System class a Univerity of Rome - La Sapienza, Master Degree in Computer Engineering<br />
The goal of the project is to have a noise map of the city, in order to achieve better booking for tourist based on their preferences: for example, young tourist may like to be near a zone with high nightlife activities(so with a higher noise of level) and viceversa a family maybe want to avoid such places. On the other side, having a noise map of the city give us the possibility to study the noise pollution in a city like Rome, that make the project really intresting in term of utilization: acquiring the noise level data allow the user to find the best place for any eventuality and allow the researchers to study the noise phenomenon<br />
